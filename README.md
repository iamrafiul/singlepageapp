# Single Page App

This is a simple NodeJS + AngularJS application. This application is just a demo app whose server is written in NodeJS and the front end is written in AngularJS. Please go through the code and see the comments to understand what's going on.

To run the code:

- Fork the repository.
- Go to the cloned directory and open the command promopt there. For windows users, go to the directory then press shift + right mouse button and you will find out 'Open command window here' :D
- Run 
    
    npm install

If you do not have NodeJS in your computer, download and install from nodejs.org

- Run
    
    node server.js

- If everything goes well, you will se a message in the shell like 'Magic happens on port 8080'

BINGO!! :D
